## What's WordWise Project?

This year I started study italian and I thought why not create a website to help me to learn languages. So, my journey in search
of a solution began! English was my second language and it's the most spoken language in the world üåé, create a website to help
people to learn english would make more sense, right? So, I found an amazing API [Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/),
this API works really well and show us some importants informations about any word that you need to know. Let me show you, friend! üéØ

As you can see, you have just to type the word and click the button "Search", then, some informations will show on your screen.
Informations like: phonetic, meanings, definitions, an audio and an example using that word...

I hope you like and enjoy this project, I have sure the WordWise will help you a lot dude! üôè
